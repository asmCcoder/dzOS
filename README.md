# dzos

dzOS is a single-user single-task ROM-based operating system (OS) for the 8-bit homebrew computer dastaZ80, which runs on a Zilog Z80 processor. It is heavily influenced by ideas and paradigms coming from Digital Researchâ€™s CP/M, so some concepts may sound familiar to those who had the privilege of using this operating system.

The OS consists of three parts:

* The **BIOS**, that provides functions for controlling the hardware.
* The **Kernel**, which provides general functions for everything that is not hardware dependent.
* The **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**, that provides commands for the user to talk to the Kernel and BIOS.

The Kernel and the CLI are hardware independendent and will work on any Z80 based computer. Therefore, by adapting the BIOS code, **dzOS can easily be ported to other Z80 systems**.
